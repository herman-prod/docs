## About the author

Hi — I’m **Herman Errico**.

I work at the intersection of **security engineering, compliance frameworks, and AI governance**, with a focus on turning abstract requirements into **runtime controls** that teams can actually implement and operate.

Over the last few years, I’ve spent a lot of time on:
- **Security control design** (policy, identity, enforcement, auditability)
- Mapping practical controls to **ISO 27001/27002**, **SOC 2**, **NIST**, and emerging **AI governance** expectations
- Building programs and tooling that make security **measurable**, **automatable**, and **repeatable**
- Thinking about how modern systems fail when autonomy increases (humans → software → AI-driven systems)

## Why I created AARM

As AI systems shift from “assistant” to “actor,” the main risk stops being what the model *says* and becomes what the system *does*:  
**tool calls, API actions, state changes, and data movement**.

AARM (Autonomous Action Runtime Management) is my attempt to name and define that missing layer:
> a runtime control plane for **authorizing, constraining, and auditing autonomous actions**.

This is not a product pitch — it’s a **blueprint** meant to be useful whether you’re building with MCP, function calling, plugins, internal tool servers, or whatever comes next.

## Open by default

This work is published **openly** on purpose.

AARM is here for:
- builders shipping agentic workflows in production
- security teams trying to govern tool-enabled AI
- researchers and standards folks who want a clean vocabulary
- anyone who needs a practical way to reason about **runtime AI actions**

You can:
- reuse the terminology and definitions
- implement the architecture patterns
- copy/paste the checklists into your own policies
- propose edits, extensions, and improvements

If you build on it, attribution is appreciated — but the priority is adoption and shared progress.
