title: "What is AARM"
description: "A runtime security system that intercepts, evaluates, and enforces policy on AI-driven actions before they execute."
---

## Definition

**Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM)** is a system specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime.
```
Agent ──► AARM ──► Tools
            │
            ▼
        Receipts
```

AARM sits between the agent and the tools it invokes. Every action flows through AARM before execution.

---

## What It Does

<Steps>
  <Step title="Intercept">
    Capture action requests before they reach tools
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate">
    Check against policy: who, what, to where, in what context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enforce">
    Allow, deny, modify, or require human approval
  </Step>
  <Step title="Record">
    Generate signed receipt for every action
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Core Principle

<Info>
The security boundary for AI agents is **tool execution**, not model outputs.
</Info>

You can't reliably control what an agent *thinks*. You can control what it *does*.

---

## Trust Model

| Component | Trust Level |
|-----------|-------------|
| AARM system | Trusted |
| Agent / LLM | Untrusted |
| User inputs | Untrusted |
| Tool outputs | Untrusted |

The agent isn't malicious—but it processes untrusted inputs. Treat it as potentially compromised.

---

## What AARM Is Not

- **Not a prompt filter** — operates on actions, not text
- **Not an observability tool** — prevents, not just observes
- **Not a specific product** — it's a specification

## Components

An AARM system has six components:

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Action Mediation Layer** | Intercepts and normalizes action requests |
| **Policy Decision Point** | Evaluates actions against policy |
| **Policy Enforcement Point** | Implements decisions (block, allow, modify) |
| **Approval Service** | Handles human-in-the-loop workflows |
| **Receipt Generator** | Creates signed audit records |
| **Telemetry Exporter** | Sends events to SIEM/SOAR |

## Action Schema
```json
{
  "action_id": "act_7f8a9b2c",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "tool": "email",
  "operation": "send",
  "parameters": {
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "subject": "Q4 Report"
  },
  "identity": {
    "human": "alice@company.com",
    "agent": "assistant-1",
    "session": "sess_abc123"
  },
  "context": {
    "prior_actions": ["db.query"],
    "data_classification": ["PII"]
  }
}
```

---

## Policy Schema
```yaml
rules:
  - name: block-pii-external
    match:
      tool: email
      operation: send
      parameters.to: { external: true }
      context.data_classification: PII
    action: DENY
    reason: "Cannot send PII externally"
```

---

## Receipt Schema
```json
{
  "receipt_id": "rct_3d4e5f6a",
  "action_id": "act_7f8a9b2c",
  "decision": "DENY",
  "policy": "block-pii-external",
  "reason": "Cannot send PII externally",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "signature": "base64-signature"
}
```

## Conformance Requirements

### Required (MUST)

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| R1 | Block actions before execution |
| R2 | Validate parameters (type, range, allowlist) |
| R3 | Support human approval workflows |
| R4 | Generate signed, offline-verifiable receipts |
| R5 | Bind actions to human + agent + session identity |

### Recommended (SHOULD)

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| R6 | Just-in-time, scoped credentials |
| R7 | Export telemetry to SIEM/SOAR |
| R8 | Capture downstream effects when possible |

---

## Implementation Options

| Architecture | Description | Bypass Resistance |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Protocol Gateway** | Proxy for MCP/tool protocols | High |
| **SDK Hook** | Embedded in agent runtime | Medium |
| **Kernel/eBPF** | OS-level interception | Very High |
