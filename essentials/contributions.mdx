## How to Submit a Contribution

AARM collects contributions through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.  
The preferred starting point for most contributions is an issue.

This process helps keep discussions focused and makes it easier to review and integrate changes.

---

### Step 1. Open a Proposal or Feedback Issue

Go to the AARM GitHub repository and select **New Issue**.

Choose the **Proposal / Feedback** template and describe:
- The problem, gap, or ambiguity you have noticed
- Why it matters in practice
- Any early ideas or directions, if applicable

### Step 2. Discuss and Refine

Discussion takes place directly in the issue.

This may include:
- Clarifying assumptions or terminology
- Exploring alternative approaches
- Narrowing the scope of the proposal
- Identifying related areas of the framework

Not every issue will result in a change, but all proposals are reviewed.

---

### Step 3. Prepare a Pull Request (If Needed)

If the proposal leads to a concrete change, you may be asked to open a pull request.

Typical steps:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your change
3. Make focused, well-scoped updates
4. Open a pull request and reference the related issue

Draft pull requests are welcome if the work is still in progress.

---

### Step 4. Review and Iteration

Pull requests are reviewed for:
- Technical accuracy
- Clarity and consistency
- Alignment with AARM’s goals and structure

Feedback and iteration are part of the process.

---

### Step 5. Merge or Close

If the contribution aligns with the framework and is ready, it will be merged.

If not, the issue or pull request may be closed with feedback explaining the decision.

## General Guidelines

- Start with a problem, not a solution
- Keep contributions focused and scoped
- Prefer clarity over completeness
- Reference real-world scenarios where possible

Smaller, well-explained contributions are often the most effective.
