## What is AARM?

**Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM)** is a security and governance layer for systems where AI doesn’t just generate text — it **takes actions** (API calls, tool invocations, database writes, tickets, emails, code changes, etc.).

AARM focuses on the invariant: **runtime execution of actions**.

## Why AARM exists

Traditional security stacks are great at **events**. But AI systems introduce a new primary risk surface: **actions**.

AARM is built for:
- **Policy enforcement in-line** (allow/deny/modify)
- **Parameter constraints** (schemas, allowlists, scoping)
- **Step-up approvals** for high-risk operations
- **Action receipts** (tamper-evident audit trail)
- **Effect capture** (what changed, not just what was called)

## Contribute

AARM is an **open source** effort. If you’re building agentic systems, tool servers, or governance layers, you can help shape the standard.
