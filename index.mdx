## What is AARM?

**Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM)** is a system specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime. As AI systems evolve from text generators into autonomous agents that execute consequential actions—API calls, database mutations, file operations, financial transactions, credential changes—a new security boundary emerges: **the action layer**.

AARM defines what a runtime security system must do to protect organizations from the unique risks of agentic AI:

## The Runtime Security Gap

The security posture of AI systems is increasingly determined not by what models *say* but by what they *do*. Traditional security paradigms fail to address four characteristics of AI-driven actions:

| Characteristic | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Irreversibility** | Tool executions produce permanent effects. Once a database is dropped or data exfiltrated, the damage is done. |
| **Speed** | Agents execute hundreds of actions per minute—far beyond human review capacity. |
| **Compositional risk** | Individual actions may satisfy policy while their composition constitutes a breach. |
| **Untrusted orchestration** | Prompt injection and indirect attacks mean the AI layer cannot be trusted as a security boundary. |

Existing tools don't solve this:

- **SIEM** observes events *after* execution—too late to prevent harm
- **API gateways** verify *who* is calling, not *what* the action means
- **Firewalls** protect perimeters—but agents operate *inside* with legitimate credentials
- **Prompt guardrails** filter text, not actions—and are easily bypassed
- **Human-in-the-loop** doesn't scale, and [can itself be exploited](https://checkmarx.com/blog/lies-in-the-loop)

## What AARM Does

AARM defines a runtime security system that:

1. **Intercepts** AI-driven actions before execution
2. **Evaluates** them against organizational policy
3. **Enforces** authorization decisions (allow, deny, modify, or require approval)
4. **Records** tamper-evident receipts for forensic reconstruction

## Core Components

An AARM-compliant system implements these components:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Action Mediation" icon="filter" href="/specification/components#action-mediation">
    Intercepts tool invocations, normalizes to canonical schema.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Policy Decision Point" icon="scale-balanced" href="/specification/components#pdp">
    Evaluates actions against policy; returns allow/deny/modify/step-up.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Policy Enforcement" icon="lock" href="/specification/components#pep">

</Columns>

## Implementation Architectures

AARM can be implemented through three architectures, each with distinct trust properties:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Protocol Gateway" icon="server" href="/architectures/gateway">
    Proxy for MCP or tool protocols. High bypass resistance, low integration effort.
  </Card>
  <Card title="SDK / Instrumentation" icon="code" href="/architectures/sdk">
    Embedded in agent runtime. Maximum context access, requires framework integration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Kernel / eBPF" icon="microchip" href="/architectures/ebpf">
    OS-level syscall interception. Cannot be bypassed by user-space code.
  </Card>
</Columns>

For defense in depth, organizations may deploy multiple architectures in layers.

## Conformance Requirements

To prevent category dilution, AARM defines minimum requirements for compliant systems:

| Requirement | Level | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **R1: In-line Authorization** | MUST | Block actions before execution based on policy |
| **R2: Parameter Validation** | MUST | Validate/constrain parameters (types, ranges, allowlists) |
| **R3: Step-up Authorization** | MUST | Support approval workflows for high-risk actions |
| **R4: Tamper-evident Receipts** | MUST | Signed records verifiable offline |
| **R5: Identity Binding** | MUST | Bind actions to human, service, and session identities |
| **R6: Least Privilege** | SHOULD | Just-in-time credentials, scoped tokens |
| **R7: Telemetry Export** | SHOULD | Structured events compatible with SIEM/SOAR |
| **R8: Effect Capture** | SHOULD | Record downstream state changes when feasible |

## Why Open Specification?

The market for AI agent security is emerging rapidly, with multiple vendors building proprietary solutions. AARM aims to:

- **Establish baseline requirements** before fragmentation forecloses interoperability
- **Enable objective evaluation** of vendor claims against defined criteria
- **Preserve buyer choice** by defining what systems must do, not how they must be built
- **Accelerate adoption** by providing implementation guidance, not just principles

The goal is not to build AARM, but to define what an AARM system must do—enabling the market to compete on implementation quality rather than category definition.
